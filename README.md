# wordSpider
crawl word from web Cambridge dictionary

This is my first project upload in github.
you provide a txt document and this crawler will find meaning and other info of the word in the txt, and write them into WordList.txt
you can start it by using "scrapy crawl wordSpider"
I probably won't change it in the future, it is just used for fun.

In the end, Hello GitHub !


这个程序能爬取Cambridge Dictionary网站上的单词信息（如果有其他人像实现类似的功能，感觉有道都会比这个网站好弄。。。）:coffee:
